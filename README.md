# Robotic Vacuum Cleaner Project

Welcome to the repository for our Robotic Vacuum Cleaner project! Our goal is to develop an autonomous vacuum cleaner using Raspberry Pi and ultrasonic sensors for efficient mapping and obstacle avoidance.

## Overview

The robotic vacuum cleaner we're building is engineered to seamlessly navigate through rooms, detect obstacles, and autonomously clean floors. It's powered by a Raspberry Pi acting as the central control unit, supported by ultrasonic sensors for precise environment perception. In addition to these core functionalities, our cleaner boasts the following features:

1. **User-friendly App Interface:** Seamlessly switch the robot on/off through our intuitive app, connected via WiFi for effortless control.
   
2. **Scheduled Cleaning:** Take advantage of our scheduling feature to automate cleaning sessions according to your preferences, eliminating the need for manual intervention.
   
3. **Wet Mopping Capability:** Beyond traditional dry vacuuming, our cleaner offers a wet mopping mode, utilizing an integrated water tank and mop pad for thorough floor cleaning.
