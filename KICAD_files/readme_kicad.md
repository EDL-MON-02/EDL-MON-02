# Robotic Vacuum Cleaner PCB Design

Welcome to the KiCad PCB design files repository for our Robotic Vacuum Cleaner project! This repository contains all the necessary files for designing the printed circuit board (PCB) used in our robotic vacuum cleaner.

## Overview

The PCB plays a crucial role in the functionality of our robotic vacuum cleaner, as it serves as the central hub for controlling various electronic components, including motor drivers, sensor interfaces, and power distribution modules.

## Repository Structure

- **KiCad Files:** This directory contains both the schematics and layout files for the PCB design. The files are organized to facilitate easy access and modification of the design.

- **Gerber Files:** This directory contains the Gerber files generated from the PCB layout, which are used for manufacturing the actual PCB.


## How to Use

1. **KiCad Files:** Open the KiCad project files (.pro) using KiCad EDA (Electronic Design Automation) software. Inside the project, you will find both the schematic and layout files, allowing you to review and modify the design as needed.

2. **Gerber Files:** These files are ready for manufacturing. You can use them to order the fabrication of the PCB from a PCB manufacturer.
