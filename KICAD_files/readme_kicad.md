# Robotic Vacuum Cleaner PCB Design

Welcome to the KiCad PCB design files repository for our Robotic Vacuum Cleaner project! This repository contains all the necessary files for designing the printed circuit board (PCB) used in our robotic vacuum cleaner.

## Overview

The PCB plays a crucial role in the functionality of our robotic vacuum cleaner, as it serves as the central hub for controlling various electronic components, including motor drivers, sensor interfaces, and power distribution modules.

## Repository Structure

- **Schematics:** This directory contains the schematics of the PCB design, detailing the connections between different components and their respective functionalities.

- **Layout:** Here, you'll find the PCB layout files, which determine the physical arrangement of components on the PCB.

- **Gerber Files:** This directory contains the Gerber files generated from the PCB layout, which are used for manufacturing the actual PCB.


## How to Use

1. **Schematics:** Open the schematic files using KiCad EDA (Electronic Design Automation) software to review and understand the connections between components.

2. **Layout:** Open the layout files in KiCad to visualize the physical arrangement of components on the PCB and make any necessary adjustments.

3. **Gerber Files:** These files are ready for manufacturing. You can use them to order the fabrication of the PCB from a PCB manufacturer.
